## Project Overview
AgriData Explorer is an interactive data visualization platform designed to explore and analyze agricultural data in India. This platform integrates data on crop production, yields, and areas under cultivation across various regions and states, providing insights that can help farmers, policymakers, and researchers make informed decisions to improve agricultural practices and productivity.

### Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify trends, patterns, and regional disparities in crop production.
- **Data Visualizations**: Interactive charts and maps showcasing agricultural statistics, including crop yields, production trends, and regional performance.
- **Power BI Integration**: Enhanced visualizations and reports for stakeholders to understand agricultural dynamics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Forecasting crop yields and recommending areas for optimal cultivation.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Visualizing agricultural performance across states and districts with interactive maps.
- **Customizable Filters**: Enabling users to filter data by region, crop type, yield, and year for personalized insights.

## Problem Statement
India's agricultural sector is critical for its economy, but the fragmented nature of agricultural data makes it challenging for stakeholders to analyze and make informed decisions. This project aims to provide an accessible platform that integrates agricultural data and presents it in an intuitive way.

### Stakeholders:
- **Farmers** can use the platform to explore historical crop production data, analyze productivity, and optimize crop choices.
- **Policymakers** can identify low-productivity regions and target interventions to improve yields.
- **Researchers** can analyze agricultural trends, including the impact of climate and soil on crop yields.

## Project Approach
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Collect data from various government and agricultural sources.
   - Clean the data to ensure consistency, handling missing values, and standardizing units.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Perform statistical analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and correlations in crop production data.

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create interactive dashboards using **Plotly** to visualize crop production, yields, and regional disparities.
   - Key visualizations include time-series graphs, bar charts, heatmaps, and geographical maps.

4. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Load data into Power BI for further analysis and create detailed dashboards for insights into regional and temporal agricultural trends.

5. **Advanced Analytics:**
   - Integrate machine learning models to forecast crop yields and recommend optimal areas for cultivation based on historical data.

6. **Geospatial Insights:**
   - Utilize geospatial data to create region-specific heatmaps and interactive maps to represent data across Indian states and districts.

## SQL Queries
Key SQL queries used for analysis:
1. **Year-wise Trend of Rice Production Across States (Top 3)**
2. **Top 5 Districts by Wheat Yield Increase Over the Last 5 Years**
3. **States with the Highest Growth in Oilseed Production (5-Year Growth Rate)**
4. **District-wise Correlation Between Area and Production for Major Crops (Rice, Wheat, Maize)**
5. **Yearly Production Growth of Cotton in Top 5 Cotton Producing States**
6. **Districts with the Highest Groundnut Production in 2020**
7. **Annual Average Maize Yield Across All States**
8. **Total Area Cultivated for Oilseeds in Each State**
9. **Districts with the Highest Rice Yield**
10. **Compare the Production of Wheat and Rice for the Top 5 States Over 10 Years**
